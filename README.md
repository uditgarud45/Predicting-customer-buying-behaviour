# Predicting-customer-buying-behaviour

## Introduction
This repository contains a predictive machine learning model that identifies the likelihood of a customer making a booking. It showcases the process of data exploration, preparation, modelling, and evaluation. The main goal of the project is to use a RandomForest model because of its interpretability and ability to rank feature importance.

## Explore and Prepare the Dataset
1) Begin with the “Getting Started” Jupyter Notebook for understanding the dataset. This includes analyzing the columns, looking at the statistical overview, and examining any missing data.
2) Prepare the dataset for the predictive model. This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling continuous variables.
3) Consider feature engineering. Think about creating new features that could make your model perform better. This could include creating interaction terms, polynomial features, or extracting information from date/time columns.

## Train a Machine Learning Model
1) Split the data into a training set and a testing set. This allows us to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
2) Train a RandomForest model on your training data. RandomForest is a flexible, easy to use machine learning algorithm that produces excellent results most of the time, even without hyper-parameter tuning.
3)Optimize your model by tuning hyperparameters. You can use methods like GridSearch or RandomSearch.

## Evaluate Model and Present Findings
1) Evaluate your model's performance using cross-validation. This helps to ensure your model's performance isn't due just to the specific arrangement of the data.
2) Output evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, f1-score, and accuracy. These metrics give a better sense of your model's performance, beyond just the raw error.
3) Visualize feature importance to understand which variables are most influential in predicting the outcome. RandomForest provides a simple way to do this.
